# CMSProject
Final project for a web enterprise class at Liberty University. This CMS is an ecommerce site built entirely by me. The site features several informational pages as well as registration, shop, cart, and checkout pages. There are three levels of access built into the page: customers who may add to and edit their cart, publishers who may add to and edit informational pages, and an admin who may do all of the above as well as managing users and products.
The front end page was built using vanilla html, css, JavaScript, and PHP. The backend is a MySQL database created using PHPMyAdmin interface.
